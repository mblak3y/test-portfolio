# Money, Money, Money: Budget vs Profit for the Marvel Cinematic Universe



## Step one: the visualization

_ Link to the Visualization: https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/which-is-the-best-performing-marvel-movie/

_The visualization I selected is an interactive graphic from a movie website that shows relationships between different movie metrics, such as budget, percentage of budget recovered, critics’ score, audience score, and the deviation between critics’ and audience scores. The dataset is based on all 35 movies within the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

_However, I chose this graphic because I was impressed by the volume of information captured using its interactive features. I like that the graph allows you to change the metrics on each axis. As shown at the bottom of the graphic, you can look at the actual budget, the percentage of budget recovered, audience ratings, critics’ ratings, and the deviations between the two. 


## Step two: the critique
_The original visual plots all of this information on a coordinate plane, with axes that can be changed based on the metric. Personally, I found the image overwhelming. When I first encountered it, I actually scrolled past it because I thought it was a header, not the actual visualization. The black background made it hard to distinguish the boundaries of the graphic and the extent of the information being shown. The lack of background borders added to the confusion. 

_Additionally, the visualization displays a large amount of information all at once. There are 35 movies within the Marvel Universe, and on first viewing, all 35 appear on the graph simultaneously. This makes it difficult to make meaningful comparisons between different franchises. As a moviegoer—the intended audience for the graphic—I typically think of Marvel films by the phases of the cinematic universe. Aside from using the release year, the graph does not allow viewers to sort or separate movies by phase, which limits the ability to identify distinctions between groups or make comparisons. I also found the use of the full movie titles cluttered and overwhelming. 

_Still, in this presentation, everything appears together, and the viewer is not able to easily parse or distinguish between comparisons. Because of the overwhelming amount of information and limited ability to filter or group the data, I do not see this graph having much utility in analytical settings. Instead, it seems designed primarily to be interactive and visually engaging for website visitors, rather than to support deeper data analysis.


## Step three: Sketch a solution


## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
