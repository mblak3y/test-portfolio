# Money, Money, Money: Budget vs Profit for the Marvel Cinematic Universe



## Step one: the visualization

Link to the Visualization: (https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/which-is-the-best-performing-marvel-movie/)

The visualization I selected is an interactive graphic from a movie website that shows relationships between different movie metrics, such as budget, percentage of budget recovered, critics’ score, audience score, and the deviation between critics’ and audience scores. The dataset is based on all 35 movies within the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

However, I chose this graphic because I was impressed by the volume of information captured using its interactive features. I like that the graph allows you to change the metrics on each axis. As shown at the bottom of the graphic, you can look at the actual budget, the percentage of budget recovered, audience ratings, critics’ ratings, and the deviations between the two. 



## Step two: the critique
The original visual plots all of this information on a coordinate plane, with axes that can be changed based on the metric. Personally, I found the image overwhelming. When I first encountered it, I actually scrolled past it because I thought it was a header, not the actual visualization. The black background made it hard to distinguish the boundaries of the graphic and the extent of the information being shown. The lack of background borders added to the confusion. 

Additionally, the visualization displays a large amount of information all at once. There are 35 movies within the Marvel Universe, and on first viewing, all 35 appear on the graph simultaneously. This makes it difficult to make meaningful comparisons between different franchises. As a moviegoer—the intended audience for the graphic—I typically think of Marvel films by the phases of the cinematic universe. Aside from using the release year, the graph does not allow viewers to sort or separate movies by phase, which limits the ability to identify distinctions between groups or make comparisons. I also found the use of the full movie titles cluttered and overwhelming. 

Still, in this presentation, everything appears together, and the viewer is not able to easily parse or distinguish between comparisons. Because of the overwhelming amount of information and limited ability to filter or group the data, I do not see this graph having much utility in analytical settings. Instead, it seems designed primarily to be interactive and visually engaging for website visitors, rather than to support deeper data analysis.


## Step three: Sketch a solution

<div style="min-height:953px" id="datawrapper-vis-2PzT9"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/2PzT9/embed.js" charset="utf-8" data-target="#datawrapper-vis-2PzT9"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/2PzT9/full.png" alt="Step 3: Money, Money, Money:  Budgets Vs Worldwide Gross in MCU Films (Bullet Bars)" /></noscript></div>


## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution


With my edited graph, I wanted to simplify it specifically to address how overwhelming the amount of information present on the original graph was. So, for this assignment, I decided to just focus specifically on capturing the relationship between the amount of money spent on the movie and the amount of money that it actually earned. I also additionally decided to focus on it by character and by phase within the MCU universe. I did this because I wanted this graphic to be catered towards casual moviegoers—people without backgrounds in data analytics—and people typically go to movies based off of characters that they are attracted to. So I figured organizing the data in this way would be relevant and appealing to the audience.

I also wanted to remove one of the axes on the graph because, as I’ll get into later, when I looked at the original visualization I thought of it as a coordinate plane, and I interpreted it specifically as having three quadrants. On my initial intake, I thought that it would make sense for movies to want to be in the third quadrant, which would indicate that there is a positive value for both of the coordinates being used. I decided to use bar graphs because, again, I'm targeting the casual moviegoer, and bar graphs really show and capture the relationship specifically by group. With that group, I grouped them by different phases within the MCU universe.
Additionally, I also changed the labels on the graphs. In removing the axes, I combined the title and the year that the movie was released, which I thought would be useful for the different characters that I was using for the MCU universe. Given that I was organizing them by character and phase within the universe, having the year next to the title of the movie would help aid with temporal organization.

As you saw on the first graph, Endgame and Infinity War repeatedly extend far beyond the scale of the other films. I built the categories to group the movies by the main characters or franchises, and those two films consistently distorted the image. They dominated the visual in a way that didn’t add meaningful insight, so I ultimately removed them to allow the other data to be interpreted more clearly. I decided instead to focus on the different phases of the MCU because I felt that this structure better captured the evolution and strategic development of Marvel’s cinematic storytelling. The phases also reflect Marvel’s long-term marketing strategy and the sequencing of film releases. Over time, these phases demonstrate how Marvel used a “blue ocean strategy”—identifying an underdeveloped niche within action and superhero films and then expanding it into a massive, interconnected universe. I also thought it was interesting how each film builds toward the next through end-credit scenes, functioning almost like narrative “Easter eggs” that guide viewers through the larger universe. Organizing the data by phase made it easier to see how the MCU grew, how audiences responded at different points in the timeline, and how Marvel’s strategies shaped the overall success of the franchise
