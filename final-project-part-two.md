# User research 

## Target audience

This project began in the early phases of an independent study planned for next semester, emerging from the intersection of professional experience as a college counselor and academic interests in education equity. The focus is on FAFSA completion rates for high schools in Washington, DC—the city where I grew up, worked, and remain deeply invested.

The primary audience includes advocates for equitable education who are concerned about how financial aid access shapes postsecondary opportunities. I hope to empower educational professionals passionate about supporting first-generation college graduates and first-generation graduate students who understand the stakes behind these numbers. I want viewers to gain an awareness of the disparities that specific student demographics face in completing the FAFSA and accessing financial aid.

I also designed these visualizations to resonate with people following current changes to the U.S. Department of Education’s definition of “professional degrees,” and others who are thinking critically about how policy shifts affect students’ pathways. Ultimately, the story I want to convey is for meant for those who both empathize with and are positioned to respond to the challenges facing marginalized students navigating the FAFSA process.

### Shorthand Storyboard



https://preview.shorthand.com/2GWq7SlvtKeoYdSl


## Interview Methodology

The approach to identifying interviewees focused on finding people with meaningful exposure to education systems and educational disparities. You sought individuals with professional experience in education, familiarity with urban schools, and awareness of how inequities show up in college access and financial aid.

Do you see a common trend within the data?

What confused you about the graphs?

What additional information would you find helpful to include in the graphs?



## Interview findings

Interviewee 1 — HCA Second-Year Student

What is the message of these graphs?


It looks like the graphs are trying to show how FAFSA completion changes over different years and across groups of students. I can see that the graphs are meant to highlight the ups and downs clearly. Even if I’m not deeply familiar with FAFSA, I can tell the overall message is about tracking participation and identifying patterns.

Do you see a common trend within the data?


Yes, I can see a trend, especially the points where the numbers drop or rise noticeably. Even with all the data, there are clear sections where things shift. The graphs seem like they’re meant to help people quickly compare those changes.

What confused you about the graphs?


The main thing was how much data was included all at once. Since everything was shown together, it took a while to understand what each line or bar was supposed to emphasize. I felt like I needed more time to interpret each graph than expected.

What additional information would you find helpful?


I think simplifying the visuals would help a lot. If the graphs focused on fewer categories, the message would stand out more clearly. A little guidance about what I’m supposed to notice first would also make them easier to follow.



Interviewee 2 — MSPPM-DA Student, Experience With Marginalized Communities

What is the message of these graphs?


The graphs are clearly trying to show disparities in FAFSA completion, especially across demographics. It looks like the purpose is to highlight how specific groups experienced different trends. The data seems aligned with issues I’ve seen in real communities.

Do you see a common trend within the data?


Definitely. The pandemic years stand out immediately because the numbers change dramatically around that period. There’s also a sense that not all demographic groups recovered at the same rate, which is a big part of the message.

What confused you about the graphs?


There wasn’t anything that confused me conceptually, but the amount of information made the graphs difficult to digest quickly. I had to keep zooming in mentally to understand parts of the trend. It might help to break things up into smaller chunks for clarity.

What additional information would you find helpful?


I’d include more detail about the pandemic years specifically—maybe walk viewers through those disruptions step-by-step. More context or labels could help emphasize the causes behind certain drops. Additional methods of analysis could also deepen the story.



Interviewee 3 — Future MSPPM/JD Student, Former Public Charter Administrator

What is the message of these graphs?


I can tell the graphs want to highlight changes in FAFSA completion, but the message is honestly hard to grasp. The visuals try to show a lot of information all at once, which makes the narrative harder to follow. I had trouble understanding what point I was supposed to walk away with.

Do you see a common trend within the data?


I think the trends are in there, but I had to work pretty hard to find them. Because everything was layered together, it wasn’t clear what part of the graph was most important. The patterns never felt obvious at first glance.

What confused you about the graphs?


The number of graphs and the volume of data were overwhelming. It seemed like too much information was presented without a clear structure guiding the viewer. I wasn’t sure where to focus or what to prioritize.

What additional information would you find helpful?


I would appreciate fewer visuals with more intentional design. Adding clearer labeling or focusing on a smaller set of groups could help me follow along more easily. More emphasis on the main takeaway would also make the graphs more digestible.



Interviewee 4 — TSWD Classmate

What is the message of these graphs?


They’re showing FAFSA outcomes, but the main message wasn’t easy to figure out. There were so many lines and categories that I found it difficult to understand what the graphs were meant to highlight. It felt like everything was competing for attention at once.

Do you see a common trend within the data?


Yes, but only after spending extra time looking closely. I noticed patterns eventually, but they weren’t immediately clear. The graphs seemed like they needed a clearer narrative.

What confused you about the graphs?


Mostly the amount of data included. Without an education background, I had trouble placing what each category represented. It made the graphs feel more complicated than they needed to be.

What additional information would you find helpful?


I think narrowing down the focus to one or two demographics per graph would help immensely. That way, the story becomes easier to follow. Even just visually separating the groups more clearly would make a difference.




Interviewee 5 — TSWD Classmate

What is the message of these graphs?


The graphs definitely relate to FAFSA data, but it was hard to see a clear message because everything was shown at once. I couldn’t quickly identify the most important point. I felt like the takeaway was buried under too many details.

Do you see a common trend within the data?


Yes, but it took effort. There are patterns across the years, especially during big shifts like the pandemic. Still, the way the graphs are currently designed made those patterns less obvious.

What confused you about the graphs?


Mostly the complexity. The graphs seemed crowded and visually heavy. I wasn’t sure what part of the data I was supposed to focus on.

What additional information would you find helpful?


I’d appreciate fewer categories and clearer visual emphasis. A simplified focus would make the graphs easier to interpret and would help highlight the core message. It would also keep me from feeling overwhelmed.

# Identified changes for Part III
> Document the changes you plan on implementing next week to address any issues identified.  

Going forward, I plan to lean into the visualization and storytelling techniques  and intentionally approach the project from a more unconventional perspective. I'm using Part 3 as an opportunity to experiment with design choices that clarify rather than complicate the story.

One specific change is to update  visuals to focus on 2–3 student demographics that are most represented among schools with the steepest declines in FAFSA completion since the COVID-19 pandemic. By centering on these groups, I will use the data to refine the narrative for the DC FAFSA Initiative and your independent study.
