# Outline

This project will show changes over time in FAFSA completion for high schools in Washington, DC. The project will focus on the school years 2019-2025- the dataset consists of data collected from the United States Department of Education, DC Public School Graduation Rates Set, and other public databases.

This project is the beginning of an independent study that I’m completing next semester. For the purpose of this assignment, I plan on creating visualizations that will guide my exploratory data analysis. I plan on using these visualizations to forecast trends across different wards, years, and schools during years in the pandemic. I specifically want to identify schools that were able to reach their pre-pandemic completion rates


I am interested in this topic because of my previous experience as a college counselor working in the District of Columbia and Montgomery County, Maryland. In that role, I worked mainly in public school and public charter school settings that served predominantly marginalized communities, i.e. black, Latino, urban, low-income, first-generation. One of my main responsibilities was supporting students and families with the completion and submission of the FAFSA. During 2018-2024, I supported as students they continued in their education. However, I also supported students that faced various obstacles that prevented them from accessing the financial aid that could’ve funded their education.

I’m particularly interested in these sets of data because it documents the numbers of FAFSAs submitted and completed in the year that COVID-19 Pandemic began (2020), the year of virtual learning (2021), the year that students began returning to school in-person (2022), and the year that in-person learning became the norm again (2023); which corresponds to the years I worked with high schools students across Washington, DC and Montgomery County, MD.

# The data

The project will begin with an overview of FAFSA completion vs submission rates across the different periods in the pandemic. this visualization will be used to compare trends over time. from there, I will go on to focus on fast food completion versus submission rates across the different wards in Washington DC. Next, I'll identify the wards that have the lowest completion and submission rates. Then, I will focus on which schools have the lowest rates and identify demographics of students that should receive targeted interventions pursuant of the DC FAFSA initiative.

Dataset of high schools in the District of Columbia. Contains raw number of FAFSAs completed and submitted by students attending schools in DC. Normalize the data by converting the raw numbers for the schools into percentages to allow for comparison

The personal demographic data, i.e. total class size, racial demographics, % of FRL recipients, etc is only limited to the public schools in DC. 
The completion and submissions rates will be compared by Wards, public vs charter, and during year in the pandemic. There will be comparisons between the number of FAFSAs submitted vs completed. 
The data will be converted into averages to allow for comparison between the districts.
This data will be used to inform my independent study next semester that will analyze relationships between FAFSA completion and personal demographics
