# Portfolio

Welcome to My portfolio for Telling Stories with Data! For the focus of the final project, my data will be definitely focus on education, specifically post-secondary access within marginalized Black communities. In the past, I've worked with FAFSA data for the programs I managed in different professional capacities. I'm looking forward to exploring different frameworks for visualizing data and reefining my project scope.

# About Me

My name is Monet Blakey and I'm a graduating MSPPM student studying at Carnegie Mellon University - Heinz College. After graduating, I would like to return to Washington, DC and continue working in education. Before coming to Heinz College, I worked in college access in the Washington, DC region- primarily at community based organizations that had partnerships with school districts, public charter school networks, and private schools. I enrolled in Heinz College because I would like to strengthen my abilities to advocate for increased resources to expanding educational access for students and families from underserved communities. 


# Goals For Telling Stories with Data

My overall goal for this course to decrease sole reliance on written text to convey key ideas and arguments. I plan to approach my goal from the following angles: 

1. Visualization Design - My prior experience writing reports, presentations, and memos gave me a foundation for using different types of visualizations to highlight key findings in datasets. After the first week of class, I am eager to learn how to strategically design graphs to reinforce key findings and and main ideas. Before this class, I primarily focused on uniformness with my graphics. 
   
2. Visualization Selection - Similar to my prior goal, I'm looking forward to applying a graphic design approach to converying information using graphics. During iniital week of class, I became aware of many opportunities for growth as different techniques strategies, and best practices for communicaiting

## Assignment: [Visualizing overnment Debt](visualizing-government-debt)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `visualizing-government-debt.md`.  For links to Markdown files in your repository, you can just include the name of the page without the `.md` extension. 

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `critique-by-design.md`.  

## Final project
Here it might be helpful to include a high-level description of your final project.

## Other stuff you can do (you can remove this section - it's just for your reference.)

### Changing text

You can change text, like this: 

**Here's some bold** text.  Here's some *italic* text. Here's some ~~strikethrough~~ text. 

### Creating tables

You can build tables like this: 

| Name         | Type of pet | Favority activity 1 | FA 2   | FA 3            | FA 4                                |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Eli          | cat         | Sleeping            | Eating | Being pet       | Plotting to overthow dog empire     |
| Howard       | dog         | You                 | You    | You             | Eating                              |
| Frankenstein | fish        | Swimming            | Eating | Blowing bubbles | Forgetting                          |

An easy-to-use template generator tool [can be found here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

You can use different headings, like this: 

# Here's a large title (H1)
## Here's a subtitle (H2)
### ...and so on (H3)
You get the idea - just don't forget the space between the # and your title.  `#Title` won't work, but `# Title` will. 

### Adding images

Here's an example of how to add an image to my portfolio.  

![funny dog picture](funny-dog-unsplash.jpg)
> Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/pt-br/@charlesdeluvio?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">charlesdeluvio</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/K4mSJ7kc0As?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a>
  

Alternately, you can set the size of the image using just a bit of HTML: 

<img src="funny-dog-unsplash.jpg" width="200"/>

Remember that you'll need to upload the image into your repository, or include a link to the image somewhere else.  

### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
