# Portfolio

Welcome to My portfolio for Telling Stories with Data! For the focus of the final project, my data will be definitely focus on education, specifically post-secondary access within marginalized Black communities. In the past, I've worked with FAFSA data for the programs I managed in different professional capacities. I'm looking forward to exploring different frameworks for visualizing data and reefining my project scope.

# About Me

My name is Monet Blakey and I'm a graduating MSPPM student studying at Carnegie Mellon University - Heinz College. Before coming to Heinz College, I worked in college access in the Washington, DC region- primarily at community based organizations that had partnerships with school districts, public charter school networks, and private schools. I enrolled in Heinz College because I would like to strengthen my abilities to advocate for increased resources to expanding educational access for students and families from underserved communities. 


# Goals For Telling Stories with Data

My overall goal for this course to decrease sole reliance on written text to convey key ideas and arguments. I plan to approach my goal from the following angles: 

1. Visualization Design - My prior experience writing reports, presentations, and memos gave me a foundation for using different types of visualizations to highlight key findings in datasets. After the first week of class, I am eager to learn how to strategically design graphs to reinforce key findings and and main ideas. Before this class, I primarily focused on uniformness with my graphics. 
   
2. Visualization Selection - Similar to my prior goal, I'm looking forward to applying a graphic design approach to converying information using graphics. During iniital week of class, I became aware of many opportunities for growth as different techniques strategies, and best practices for communicaiting with audiences comprised of various stakeholders. 
   

# After Heinz

Following graduation, I would like to return to Washington, DC and continue championing for increased educational equity. Since comong Heinz, my career aspirations shifted to regulation - veering away from legislation. Since completing Heinz' core course, my strategic problem framework increasing in effectiveness drawing on quantatitative approaches, such as statisitcs, economics, and management science, from a liberak arts based approach. 

After graduation, I would to like to apply my insights and experiences of Heinz to improve educational outcomes for urban students in Washington, DC.
